A 3D action platformer where you fight colossal bullet-hell bosses in arenas without floors.

You are the last Tokigami-Miko, racing to bind a shattered world by challenging gods turned machines. Survive by stepping on what tries to kill you—riding debris and bullet swarms—while bending time to carve paths through chaos
